## Project Title

Satirical News Corpus

## Background

Fake news is a form of news that consists of deliberate misinformation that is spread widely through digital media. This has been a growing issue in recent times especially with the advent of social media where people share posts without often verifying the legitimacy. Their sole purpose is often to mislead the audience and or cause widespread chaos. So, it has become increasingly important to identify fake news from legitimate ones. Although there is no aggregated collection of fake news, there are many websites around the world that post satirical news. We are hopeful that our corpus can act as an example of fake news. Satire and fake news have very similar properties, both use controversial misinformation to reach a wide audience. The corpus includes 11438 satirical news headlines from [the ONION](https://www.theonion.com) and 509 headlines were annotated using Mechnical Turk.

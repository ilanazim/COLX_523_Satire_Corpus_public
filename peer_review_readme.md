# Satire Corpus Interface

## How to use:

To use our interface, follow the instructions [here](https://github.ubc.ca/yan05/COLX_523_Satire_Corpus_public/blob/master/README.md). The page will show a list of satirical news headlines that were annotated using Mechanical Turk. You can both search for keywords and show annotations using the search bar and check box on the left of the page. When checking the "Show Annotations" make sure to click on the text and not in the checkbox itself. 

The annotations highlight the portion of the text that make the news headline unrealistic or satirical. Because the ~ 500 headlines sent for annotations are from the recent past, they predominantly cover current events, especially around North America. 

Here are a few ideas of keywords to search for:
* corona 
* Trump
* president
* election

Enjoy and let us know if you have any questions!
